# biola-styleguide
Styleguide for biola frontend websites.


## Development

    # Clone project
    git clone git@github.com:biola/styleguide.git
    
    # Move into project folder
    cd styleguide
    
    # Install gulp packages that are needed for development
    npm install
    
    # Build assets, start server, and watch for changes
    gulp
    
The server should start at http://localhost:8080 by default. As long as gulp is running, it will automatically watch for changes in the `src` folder and recompile the changes into the `dist` folder.
